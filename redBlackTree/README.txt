---Project 5 consists of 1 files: mainclass.java
---IDE used is Eclipse IDE for Java Developers-Version: Photon Release (4.8.0)
---According to the requirements, the program asks the users to select a size of the lists, it will then display
the running time for each method of choosing the pivot for the quicksort. It also writes the unsorted lists and sorted lists
into 2 output files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the records, there was a big difference in the run time of each quicksort algorithm, the the size changed. 
for example, when the size was 10 times greater, the run time was also over 10 times greater.  
Because the lists consist of randomly generated elements, using the first element as the pivot makes the fastest quicksort 
because creating the median as well as random number generation are generally expensive. 

Thank you!
